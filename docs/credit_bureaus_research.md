# Credit Bureaus Research Findings

## The Three Major Credit Bureaus

### Overview
The three major credit reporting agencies (CRAs) in the United States are:
1. **Experian**
2. **Equifax** 
3. **TransUnion**

These agencies collect and organize consumer credit data to create credit reports that are used by lenders, employers, and other authorized entities to make decisions about creditworthiness.

### Key Findings from Initial Research

#### Security and Compliance Considerations
