## Advanced Industry Tactics and Street Wisdom

### Industry Expert Strategies (Corey Gray Method)

#### Student Loan Dispute Tactics:
- **Myth Busting**: Student loans CAN be disputed despite common misconceptions
- **Legal Right**: Consumers have the right to challenge anything inaccurate, outdated, or questionable
- **Blowback Reality**: Disputing does NOT trigger lawsuits or garnishments
- **Government Backing**: Federal student loans are backed by government but can still be disputed
- **Strategic Approach**: Treat student loans like any other tradeline for dispute purposes

#### Bankruptcy Removal Strategy:
- **Key Insight**: Courts do NOT report bankruptcies to credit bureaus
- **Data Source**: Bureaus purchase bankruptcy data from third parties (LexisNexis, PACER)
- **False Reporting**: Bureaus incorrectly list "Court" as furnisher - this is an FCRA violation
- **Step-by-Step Process**:
  1. Dispute bankruptcy with all three bureaus
  2. When bureaus verify, send letter to actual court with prepaid envelope
  3. Request court's verification procedure with credit bureaus
  4. Court responds they DON'T report to bureaus
  5. Send court's response to bureaus as proof of violation
  6. Usually results in deletion due to proven FCRA violation
  7. If not deleted, file CFPB complaint with court documentation

#### Charge-Off Removal Tactics:
